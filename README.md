# learning

I start this project to improve my skills in Java development using different frameworks and technologies

# Installation

In this project, I use MySQL so you need to install the MySQL server. All connection properties can be found in the application.properties file. Remember to create a database before starting the application.

Also in the application.properties file there is all configuration for google SMTP server which is used to send user activation e-mails.

By default you have the user with ADMIN role available by credentials:
Login: admin 
Password: admin

The project was created for learning purposes only
